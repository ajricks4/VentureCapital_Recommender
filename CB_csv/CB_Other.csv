Accelerator Fund,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accelerator-fund,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",,,"Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,"The Accelerator Fund, LLC makes early stage investments in life sciences companies located in western Pennsylvania. As the first fund sponsored and managed by the professionals of the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse (PLSG), the Accelerator Fund is in the unique position of leveraging the talents and insights of those most closely aligned with western Pennsylvania’s robust reputation as an incubator for a new American spirit of entrepreneurial talent in biotechnology and the life sciences. The $8.1M Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse (PLSG) Accelerator Fund I provides life sciences companies with venture capital financing, which is the next step beyond capital provided by economic development organizations; friends and family; and angel investors. The PLSG Accelerator Fund, separate from and complementary to the PLSG, is building a portfolio of early-stage life sciences investments, primarily located in western Pennsylvania and spread across several life sciences sectors including medical devices, diagnostics, therapeutics, healthcare information technology and biotechnology tools. The PLSG Accelerator Fund I currently has eight portfolio companies and is fully invested. The value proposition of the Accelerator Funds is at least 2-fold: (1) PLSG executives manage the Funds, affording investors with a quality of personnel and depth of domain experience that likely would be otherwise available only through significantly larger funds; (2) the PLSG seeks to de-risk companies for Fund investors by investing, with its own early-stage dollars, in companies before the Fund invests. Only companies that already have performed successfully using PLSG investments or have demonstrated their potential by going through the PLSG diligence process are considered for Fund investment. A unique attribute of the Funds is that all the companies that are a part of our portfolio have already been vetted by the PLSG through due diligence, mentoring by the PLSG’s Executive Program services, and/or investments made through PLSG investment programs. The bottom line is that the Accelerator Funds represent a fundamental part of the PLSG’s commitment to generate long-term sustainability for PLSG portfolio companies while creating the best opportunity for returns for fund investors. Accelerator Fund executives all have domain and Fortune 100 company experience, having worked with companies such as Johnson & Johnson; Bristol-Meyers Squibb, and Boston Scientific, among others. They also have prior experience working successfully with early-stage companies. Each of the executives works with a particular vertical in our overall portfolio, developing existing portfolio companies; identifying potential additional portfolio companies.",16,,,,,Active,Accelerator Fund makes early stage investments in life sciences companies located in western Pennsylvania.,,,,,,,,http://www.acceleratorfund.com,info@plsg.com,,,"Micro VC, Venture Capital","Early Stage Venture, Seed",7,9,,1,,,,,,"15,523",-0.1,-0.1,1.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,

VC Perspective Having worked as a venture capitalist for several years, we provide a VC's perspective to the management team before companies approach venture capital firms. Given VC firms are usually presented with a large number of investment opportunities and typically invest in a very small number of companies, we work very closely with the management team in presenting their value proposition to the investors properly and in the most efficient manner. Additionally, as VCs look for certain key attributes in investment opportunities, we assist the companies to highlight and communicate these points effectively. Investor Contacts Most VC firms specialize by stage, sector or geographical preference and usually work with a trusted ecosystem of executives, advisors and other venture capital firms when making new investments. Over the last decade, we have worked with over 100+ venture capital firms (including most top-tier VCs) closely in various roles ranging from sharing portfolio companies as investment opportunities, board advisors and co-investors.

SCF receives no state funds and is not tax supported. In 1969, the Arizona Legislature separated SCF from the Industrial Commission, allowing SCF to begin operating as a private business. The Legislature continued to cut ties with SCF in 1983, when it exempted the company from following state procurement rules under Title 35. In 1990, a further separation occurred, when the Legislature removed SCF from the state personnel and state risk management systems. And in 2004, a Maricopa County Superior Court Judge ruled that SCFâ€:tm:s fiduciary duty is to its policyholders and not to the State of Arizona. SCF is fully competitive and operates under the same rules, rate structure and regulations as all private insurance companies providing workersâ€:tm: compensation insurance in Arizona. In 2007, SCF Arizona launched SCF Premier Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary that gives the company more flexibility in premium rates for SCFâ€:tm:s largest and safest companies.

Winterpoint Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/winterpoint-capital,"Birmingham, Alabama, United States",,,Southern US,,"VISION At Winterpoint Capital, we believe that only one thing marks the boundary between failure and success. People. We also believe in investing in ideas that challenge the status quo. That’s why we search for founders who are driven to solve meaningful problems that are often ignored. These days, the venture capital market is filled with excess—capital flows to an abundance of ideas that disregard social, environmental, and regional impacts. We believe that a sustainable startup space involves funding companies that, instead of just providing a product or service serve larger, more significant goals. ​Founded in 2017 in Birmingham, Alabama—a thriving and growing startup ecosystem in the heart of the South—Winterpoint Capital's aim from the start has been to invest in ideas that generate long-term value for all stakeholders, whether they be communities, cities, or the world. As such, we’ve set out to adapt and apply a value approach to venture capital by seeking out and investing in opportunities within the human networking, sustainability, and regional economic growth spaces that are often overlooked. Investment Focuses Human Networking: Much of the value we find in life comes from our ability to connect with others. We look to people for support in most, if not all of the endeavors we pursue. Many of the great innovations we take for granted today like the internet, smartphones, and modern medicine were all products of collaborative work. We believe that innovation happens at the intersection of creativity and collaboration, and as such, companies that focus on making human interactions more meaningful are ever so integral in our technologically-driven world.   Sustainability: In an increasingly global community, sustainability and initiatives to promote it have never been more important. However, ventures in sustainability are still often regarded as investments that lack immediate payoffs and therefore receive less capital. We see it differently. Ventures in sustainability can generate immediate value while considering long-term impacts to subsequent generations. Investing in startups that build sustainability into their products and services allows us to generate returns while contributing to a better future.   Regional Economic Growth: It’s well known that the East and West Coasts of the United States boast large startup communities with big name companies and numerous venture capital firms. For years, those regions have been the undisputed hubs for innovation and technology. The South, in contrast, hasn't had a long history of tech innovation but has recently seen a pickup in tech sector growth, with cities like Birmingham and Nashville hitting their strides. As a firm located in the South, we aim to invest in regionally-based startups with the goal of positively impacting the economic growth within our ecosystem.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/winterpointcapital/,https://facebook.com/winterpointcapital,,Active,"Winterpoint Capital is a privately owned venture capital firm investing in human networking, sustainability, and regional economic growth.",2017-01-01,year,,,,,,https://www.winterpointcapital.com/,management@winterpointcapital.com,(251) 333-8432,,Venture Capital,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",1,1,,,,,,,,"24,590",1.8,1.9,-0.1,,92.29,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,

Vencore Capital provides clients with rapid access to capital to support strategic growth initiatives, including critical capital equipment purchases, product development, and go-to-market strategies. By leveraging funds from Vencore, companies can extend their operating cash runway, achieve key milestones, move closer to breakeven/profitability, increase company valuation, and minimize shareholder dilution. Vencore Capital is unique among venture debt financing firms because of its focus on providing funds earlier in a companyâ€™s growth cycle and its willingness to do smaller deals ($75,000 to $2,000,000) with more flexible structures and pricing tailored to each clientâ€™s specific needs.",,,,,,Active,"Vencore Capital provides venture debt financing to early-stage, emerging-growth companies.

Provo Labs has quickly built a strong core team of dedicated employees who are building web sites that can turn into successful businesses. The Provo Labs culture is unique in Utah. They are highly focused on constant networking and learning and they freely share that learning among themselves and with others in the community. All of their companies have official blogs and all of their employees blog. They are all into RSS feeds, Google alerts, podcasting and video blogging. They buy Blackberries for every employee and invite everyone to attend technology and business conferences regularly, so they can all stay on the cutting edge. They use LinkedIn to find contractors, employees and partners. Their technologists, led by Phil Burns, are totally into Web 2.0. They study new web services weekly and share their code libraries with each other. While they develop and use modular technology to do web mashups they also believe that they can reuse their marketing tactics and business models to do ""business mashups."" They think they will succeed as an internet business incubator because they will focus all of their companies on the things they are best at: 1) content acquisition 2) search engines 3) building community and user-generated content 4) internet marketing and 5) subscription business models. One of their doctrines that describes their Provo Labs culture states: ""Most value creation happens outside of the office. Get out of the office!"" What that means is that they know that their relationships with other people, including customers, investors, business owners, and key employees at hundreds of other companies, will be the most important factor in their success. They wholeheartedly subscribe to the concepts in ""The Only Sustainable Edge"" by Harvard Business School professor John Hagel. They focus on what they are great at and then they spend most of their time networking at the edge with their customers and business partners, to make sure they are interfacing with all the right companies that are increasing their capacity faster than anyone else.
