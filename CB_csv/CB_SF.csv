However, it has become apparent that introducing AI to traditional industries requires a new and more collaborative approach.

Instead, they have a whole assortment of other common needs and challenges with building their businesses. That’s why we didn’t stop at the fund. We created the Labs programs, each providing an environment in which to build and grow companies. We partner with established industry brands to give startups access to vital resources and knowledge that otherwise would be out of reach. Together, we set up programs to help startups and partners discover new insights about how AI and robotics can transform industries like healthcare, agriculture, construction, transportation, and more.

But we humans are hard wired to seek approval, to want to be popular. Which is precisely why so few of us are successful entrepreneurs. To build a massively successful business - you have to be comfortable with being unpopular. You have to go where no one else goes, to make decisions that some people don't like, and to push forward with conviction even when there's no one to cheer you on.  Unpopular Ventures is a new Venture Capital firm, dedicated to the entrepreneurs who are proud to be unpopular. We love opportunities that are off the beaten path, particularly when they are led by outstanding teams who have discovered something surprising. Our favorite companies are the ones with ideas that seem easy to dismiss, and yet there is a hidden, under-served group of customers who absolutely love it.  Unpopular Ventures currently operates as an AngelList syndicate - where we have over 500 LPs, and have invested $2.5 M across 11 companies so far in 2019.
