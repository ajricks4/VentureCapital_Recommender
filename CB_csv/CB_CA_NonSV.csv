A typical investment involves $2 million to $5 million in capital, and they prefer to act as a lead or co-lead investor early in the process of value formation. They believe that beginning early with a company is the best way to utilize their experience in building value rapidly by focusing the company on a small number of key milestones. Given their personal experience in running venture-backed companies, Palomar's partners understand the frustrations of the entrepreneur in dealing with the venture community. Their philosophy includes a commitment to responding rapidly to new ideas and business plans, and to forming partnerships with the goal of creating sustainable companies for the long term.",76,,,,,Active,Palomar Ventures was launched in 1999 by veteran venture capitalists to focus on early stage information technology companies that,1999-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.palomarventures.com,,,,Venture Capital,"Debt, Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture",45,94,,21,35,35,,,,"16,428",-0.1,0,-0.1,24,57.39,,5,,2,,,,"34,136,201",,,6,,,,,,,,87650,USD,87650

The four original Managing Directors of Shepherd Ventures were George Kenney, Peter Fisher, Tom Siegel and Richard Kuntz. The region has vibrant high technology and life sciences industries, is underserved by the venture capital community, and offers compelling investment opportunities. Shepherd Ventures focus is on information technology and life sciences companies characterized by passionate and experienced management teams, compelling value propositions and extraordinary upside potential. They concentrate on companies located in Southern California and the Southwest, particularly San Diego, where they believe there is a significant shortage of venture capital. Their objective is to generate significant capital appreciation through a balanced portfolio of first and later stage equity investments in carefully selected, wisely shepherded growth companies. First stage companies are those with products that incorporate a disruptive technology, that are (or are about to be) commercially released, and that are capable of creating a valuable new paradigm in their category. In particular, Shepherd Ventures look for companies with completed products, where sales channels have been defined, and when possible, validated by a purchase order or letter of intent from a bona fide customer. Companies should exhibit a sustainable competitive advantage that will drive them to market or sector dominance and a credible path to profitability. Investments in these companies may be part of the first or second round of institutional capital. Seed stage opportunities will generally not be considered. Later stage companies are those that either have received prior rounds of venture capital, or have achieved growth and operational maturity without venture funding. These companies would be established technology companies with existing revenue and proven management teams. They likely will have profitable products, brand identity, market traction, and satisfied customers. The Shepherd Ventures Managing Directors, Venture Partners and Advisors are industry leaders who have extensive experience operating, guiding and investing in first and later stage information technology and life sciences companies. Shepherd Ventures takes pride in its people. They have a dynamic team of experienced professionals who hold diverse, yet extremely relevant backgrounds.

In 1990, McClatchy began publishing on the East Coast with the purchase of three daily newspapers in South Carolina: The Herald in Rock Hill, The Island Packet on Hilton Head Island, and The Beaufort Gazette. In 2004, McClatchy purchased the Merced Sun-Star and five affiliated non-dailies in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. The newspapers, situated between Modesto and Fresno, serve a fast-growing region and provided a good strategic fit with McClatchyâ€™s other Central Valley papers. In 2006, McClatchy purchased Knight Ridder Inc. to become the second-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. Of Knight Ridderâ€™s 32 daily newspapers, McClatchy immediately announced its intentions to sell 12 that didn't fit its longstanding acquisition philosophy of buying newspapers in fast-growing markets. The 20 daily newspapers retained in the Knight Ridder acquisition were: The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, Calif.; The Bellingham Herald and The Olympian in Washington; The Idaho Statesman in Boise; The Kansas City Star in Missouri; The Olathe News and The Wichita Eagle in Kansas; the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Texas; the Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois; the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer and The Telegraph in Georgia; the Sun Herald in Biloxi, Miss.; the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky; the Centre Daily Times in Pennsylvania; The Miami Herald, Bradenton Herald and El Nuevo Herald in Florida; The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina; and The Sun News and The State in South Carolina. As part of its analysis of the Knight Ridder acquisition, McClatchy sold the Star Tribune in 2007. The sale of its largest newspaper made McClatchy the third-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. In 2008, The Olathe News converted from daily publication to twice-weekly.",228,http://twitter.com/McClatchyCo,http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-mcclatchy-company,http://www.facebook.com/McClatchyCo,,Active,"McClatchy is a publicly news publisher with 30 newsrooms including The Miami Herald, Charlotte Observer, Kansas City Star and Sacramento Bee",1857-01-01,year,1998-02-12,day,,,For Profit,http://www.mcclatchy.com,jlofaro@mcclatchy.com,,,Corporate Venture Capital,Early Stage Venture,12,16,,3,2,2,,,,"5,332",-0.9,-1.9,-0.8,"102,176","81,336.15",8.57%,439,0.12%,6.12,2.71%,22.16%,-0.87%,"338,409","-11,911",-3.4%,78,175,"9,882",31,0,1,,Education; entertainment,130172202,USD,130172202

Mentor Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mentor-capital,"Ramona, California, United States",,,"Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US",,"Mentor Capital, Inc. (MNTR) is a public company that invests in medical and social use cannabis companies. Mentor takes a 10% to 100% position in the various members of our family of participating companies, but leaves operating control firmly in the hands of the cannabis company founders. Because adult social use and medical marijuana opportunities often overlap, Mentor Capital participates in the legal recreational marijuana market. However, Mentor’s preferred focus is medical and the company seeks to facilitate the application of cannabis to cancer wasting, calming seizures, Parkinson’s disease, reducing ocular pressures from glaucoma and blunting chronic pain. Mentor’s approach and capital structure allows its shareholders to buy an additional $140 million of Mentor shares at approximately a 12.5% discount. As money is sent in to buy into the growing cannabis portfolio, the proceeds are split pro rata amongst the cannabis companies that are participating in the indirect sale. As more private cannabis companies join in the consortium, the MNTR share price is pushed higher, other things being equal. The increasing share price may well increase the exercise of stock options and warrants by both Mentor Capital’s 1,500 mostly accredited shareholders and the public market in general. Using this approach, Mentor seeks to deliver a higher price to founders for a smaller slice of their business. Retaining control and receiving more cash are the two key advantages to cannabis founders working with Mentor Capital, Inc. Mentor Capital migrated to the cannabis space from leading-edge cancer investments when government actions collapsed the new leading cancer sector (e.g. Dendreon, the market leader, dropped from $44 per share to $2.90 per share.) Mentor still retains some cancer investments, but will complete the shift to the cannabis marketplace as profitable opportunities to exit present themselves. Originally, Mentor Capital was formed in Silicon Valley in 1985 with $1,000 by current CEO, Chet Billingsley. The company completed dozens of early private acquisitions and went public in 1995. Mentor Capital feels there is significant opportunity to approach the medical marijuana market as a business-focused, high-integrity, public company providing significantly more financing to private cannabis companies. As a result, Mentor will be able to return increasing stock value to the investing public. As a distinct first step in this direction, the Mentor CEO has placed his shares in escrow with a law firm to obviate the risk of pump and dump activity that has otherwise been associated by regulators with other public marijuana related firms. Cannabis related firms seeking a larger amount of long-term cooperative financing, for a smaller slice of their business, are encouraged to contact Mentor Capital to discuss reserving their pro rata portion of Mentor’s $140 million authorized raise.",8,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mentor-capital-inc-mntr-,,,Active,Public Market Funding for Cannabis.,1985-01-01,year,2008-09-09,day,,,,http://mentorcapital.com,,(760) 788 – 4700,,Venture Capital,Early Stage Venture,4,4,,3,1,1,,,,"3,157",-0.3,-0.4,1.2,61,542.35,257.89%,86,"2,766.67%",2,0%,,,"31,757,268","-3,063,179",-8.8%,46,,,16,0,1,,Insurance; financial affairs,334253,USD,334253

In the last decade there has been a nearly unrecognizable change in the technology and financing landscape. Nevertheless, there are still a number of challenges. A number of firms still have investment committees located in distant places. A straightforward transaction can sometimes take between 6 months and a year to close. This time scale must be viewed in the context that significant developments in high technology market segments are often changing every 100 days. When ever a paradigm shift takes place there is the opportunity to create value. Conversely value can also be lost during a paradigm shift. What become significant in understanding paradigm movement is velocity, direction and value displacement. One of the major drivers in technology is regulation. Legislators and the courts can control, if they choose, with precision, paradigm shifts. The strategy of Paradigm Ventures is to target ventures that have exceptional growth potential and the ability to move to the next logical step of an enterprise's maturity level.

During the evaluation process, we often engage prospective exit partners in preliminary discussions about the potential value of the innovation, and their appetite for acquiring the entity should it prove to be viable.
