Partners Innovation Fund,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/partners-innovation-fund,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,"The Innovation Fund was created in 2007 by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital to address a growing unmet need for funding emerging technology in the capital gap between invention and product development. The main objective of the fund is to accelerate to market technologies developed by Partners HealthCare investigators, thereby enhancing healthcare quality, cost and outcomes. Structured as a separate LLC entity, the $35M Fund is evergreen in design and will reinvest all gains from investments back into the Fund to create capital for additional investments. Investment decision oversight is provided by an independent external committee composed of experts from industry, venture capital and academia. The Fund operates on a venture capital model whereby opportunities are rigorously evaluated on the basis of scientific strength as well as potential for commercial success. The Fund has four major goals: * Capture more value from the PHS research portfolio by creating companies, technologies and solutions that advance and enhance healthcare. * Provide funding for technologies positioned in the capital gap between invention and clinical development. * By demonstrating institutional commitment, attract external capital that will leverage and encourage co-investment. * Generate a return on investment to refresh the fund and provide capital for additional technologies. Gap Funding Over the last five to seven years, the environment for early-stage investing has undergone significant change. As a result of these changes, there is a dearth of funding support for technologies/companies positioned between invention and clinical development. By focusing on this capital gap, the Fund can advance technologies of high commercial potential and medical benefit to a stage where larger, more traditional investment sources are attracted to underwrite the risk. Types of Fund Investments The Partners Innovation Fund will make two types of investments: Equity and Development. Equity investments are seed and early financings that will catalyze company formation. These investments will often be a Series A stock and co-investors are frequently other early institutional investors, private investors or corporate investment funds. Development investments precede company formation and are intended to validate technologies with a high potential for later commercialization by either new venture formation or out-licensing to an existing market player. For all investments, funds will be reserved for participation in follow-on investments. Innovation Fund Process Utilizing a proven venture capital based diligence model, the team conducts in-depth diligence on all opportunities in two steps: 1. Initial Screening: Assesses opportunities for high commercial potential. Key project attributes are: * Product concept and value proposition * Intellectual Property Position * Stage of technology development * Market Opportunity * Technology Review * Management Team * Regulatory pathway * Funding requirements * Competitive Analysis * Business Model  2. Evaluation and Investment Decision: During this step, PIF staff conducts extensive diligence to assess the strength of the proposed business in relation to our investment criteria. This process takes place over 3 to 6 months during which time we interact with technical and market experts, possible customers, competitors and potential co-investors as we prepare for presentation of the investment opportunity to our external Investment Committee for final approval. The team will work with investigators and their advisors to develop a project or business plan including connections to potential entrepreneurs, advisors and investors in the venture, private or corporate arena. Venture Launch / Ongoing Support: Once an investment has been approved, the Innovation Fund plays an active role in the ongoing development of the new venture. The team will work on all aspects required to move the new entity forward including recruiting senior management and staff, providing guidance and support in technology development, serving on the Board of Directors and working with management to achieve milestones.",11,https://www.twitter.com/partnersnews,,https://www.facebook.com/partnershealthcare,,Active,"Partners Innovation Fund provides the necessary support to advance innovations in medical systems, therapy, drugs and medical devices.",2007-01-01,year,,,,,,http://innovation.partners.org/for-entrepreneurs,,857-307-2400,,Venture Capital,"Debt, Early Stage Venture, Seed",19,30,,3,9,9,,,,"9,366",-0.4,-0.8,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Engine,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-engine,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States",,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,"The Engine, which was publicly announced on October 26, 2016, was built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prioritizing breakthrough ideas over early profit, The Engine represents an exciting new system for startup support, one that shortens the time from idea to investment, and from investment to impact. To fuel The Engine, MIT is seeking to attract hundreds of millions of dollars of support and to provide hundreds of thousands of square feet of space for entrepreneurs in Kendall Square and nearby communities, starting with 26,000 square feet in its Central Square headquarters. The Engine provides a physical space where an idea can begin to take shape. It also streamlines the legal processes and agreements required to get products to market. And it links entrepreneurs to “patient capital” from investors who share their vision of addressing big challenges with big ideas. The Engine will eventually support up to 60 locally based startups concurrently; these companies will participate in the accelerator for up to 12 months. The Engine will make meaningful investments that will allow participating startups to get off the ground quickly and operate long enough to prove their concepts’ viability. It will also provide business planning, legal, and administrative support. The Engine will require less equity than is typical, allowing founders to maintain more control over their companies and the ideas they’ve created. Through the Engine Room, The Engine will provide access to a wide network of lab space, specialized equipment, business guidance, and other resources, at MIT and beyond.",3,https://twitter.com/enginexyz,https://www.linkedin.com/company/11104324/,https://www.facebook.com/enginexyz,,Active,The Engine is an enterprise designed to support new companies working on scientific and technological innovation.,2016-10-26,day,,,,,,http://www.engine.xyz/,hello@engine.xyz,,,Venture Capital,,18,21,,9,,,,,,"3,663",-0.5,-2,3.3,"13,523","15,667.77",-1.29%,171,-14.58%,9.57,22.87%,45.74%,-6.1%,"1,263,428","59,888",4.98%,44,,,,,,,,,,

The group was formed in February 2004 and since then has made a number of investments in companies in medical devices, IT, consumer products, business products, specialty materials, Internet, aviation, etc. They believe they contribute more than money to the companies they fund and welcome the opportunity to work with entrepreneurs open to take advice, yet having the smarts and determination to make the company successful. Their focus is on early stage companies usually looking to raise $250K to $1.5M, where they can fund a portion of the round and syndicate the deal with other angel groups or early stage venture funds. The stage of the company should be close to commercialization, while the company should have a clear and defensible competitive advantage. They are looking for capital efficient businesses, which can reach profitability with less than $5M of equity investment and provide at least 10X return on the investment within 5 years. They do not invest as a fund - each of their members makes his or her individual investment decision but they collaborate in Due Diligence. They have a deep expertise in the life sciences field where they usually take the position of a lead investor, but are open to any opportunities that can make a strong business case. In some cases they prefer to be the follow on investor if they cannot identify a person with strong expertise within their group. The groupâ€™s strategy is directed by an executive committee which consists of 8 people elected by the group: Wayne Griffith (chairman), Bill McPhee, Henry Kay, Jay Schwartz (membership director), Steve Andress, Peter Miller, Don Freeman and Mic Williams (president and founder). The groupâ€™s day-to-day operations are managed by Boris Batchvarov (managing director).

The screening committee consists of volunteers from the group.

New business creation is essentially a collaborative enterprise where success requires continuous learning and broad-based sharing of innovative ideas. Based in Boston, they deploy capital in early-stage companies located in the eastern U.S. and Canada. Today, they have two separate investment teamsâ€”one focused on early stage ventures in IT/Adv.Materials technologies and the other focused on life sciences. To date, VIMAC investments have led to the creation of over 20 successful companies that continue to generate business innovations in IT, communications, and Internet technologies. These investments today account for over $2 billion in market value. The fund seeks to make about five new investments each year. A new investment typically goes into a Series A or Series B round with adequate reserves to support subsequent funding until the company exits via a trade sale or an IPO. Over its lifetime, a company is likely to receive $5 million to $15 million from the fund. The life sciences team makes investments from the VIMAC Milestone Medica in early stage biotechnology and medical device companies. They lead or co-lead most investments and their managers play a very active role on portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors. Often, they invest in a company's first institutional round of funding and maintain support throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle. Along the way, they maintain a close working relationship with the management team, helping them refine business plan, build go-to-market strategies, enhance capital efficiency, find early customers and partners, and grow the business.",1,,,,,Active,"VIMAC's investing model is founded on two core principlesâ€”respect for the entrepreneur, and humble acceptance that nobody has seen the",1982-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.vimac.com,info@vimac.com,617-350-9800,,Venture Capital,"Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture",14,18,,7,5,5,,,,"20,727",0.4,0.2,1.9,476,687.69,,51,,3,,,,"14,997,922",,,13,,,,,,,,142913,USD,142913

We prefer investment opportunities that already have the CEO on board who is capable of guiding the company through liquidity. On average, we invest $5-7 million per company, and we typically invest half of that amount in the first round of funding with similar amounts reserved for future private financing rounds. When we invest at an early stage of a company's development, we pursue a more conservative reserve policy, investing less per first round than many other comparable-sized funds. We believe that this strategy mitigates the increased risk inherent at that stage of investment and positions Salix Ventures to be a dependable participant in later rounds. We always invest with at least one other, high-quality, institutional venture investor in every investment.

Action Potential Venture Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/action-potential-venture-capital,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States",,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,"GlaxoSmithKline today announced the launch of Action Potential Venture Capital (APVC) Limited, a new $50 million strategic venture capital fund that will invest in companies that pioneer bioelectronic medicines and technologies.  The fund’s first investment will be in SetPoint Medical, a California company considered a trailblazer in creating implantable devices to treat inflammatory diseases. The fund complements the work of GSK’s Bioelectronics R&D unit, which was established in 2012 after a two-year effort to seek out and engage the most promising researchers in this emerging area of science.  The name of the fund comes from electrical signals called action potentials that pass along the nerves in the body. Irregular or altered patterns of these impulses may occur in association with a broad range of diseases.  GSK believes that miniaturised devices, or bioelectronic medicines, can be designed to read these patterns. The devices could be designed to interface between the peripheral nervous system and specific organs to read, change or generate electronic impulses that help treat disorders as diverse as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis; respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD and metabolic diseases including Type 2 diabetes. The field of bioelectronic medicines is in its very early stages. GSK’s ambition, through collaboration with scientists globally, is to have the first medicine that speaks the electrical language of our body ready for approval by the end of this decade.“We want to help create the medicines of the future and be the catalyst for this work,” said Moncef Slaoui, chairman of R&D and architect of GSK’s early stage investment strategy. “GSK can play the integrating role that is needed to drive this new type of medical treatment all the way from the bench to the patient and this fund is a key part of our efforts.” Action Potential Venture Capital intends to build a portfolio of five to seven companies over the next five years. The fund will focus investments in three areas: - New start-up companies that aim to pursue the vision of bioelectronic medicines - Existing companies with technologies that are interacting with the peripheral nervous system  through first-generation devices that can stimulate or block electrical impulses - Companies advancing technology platforms that will underpin these treatment modalities Action Potential Venture Capital will be based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and managed by a small, dedicated team. The fund has named Imran Eba as its first partner. Imran will move from GSK’s Worldwide Business Development organisation and work closely with the Bioelectronics R&D unit.",11,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/9130275?trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A9130275%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1441824670372%2Ctas%3AAction%20Potential%20Venture%20Capital,,,Active,Action Potential Venture Capital is a strategic venture capital fund that invests in bioelectronic medicine and technology companies.,,,,,,,,http://www.actionpotentialvc.com/,,,,Venture Capital,Early Stage Venture,5,9,,1,,,,,,"15,759",0.4,-0.2,-1.1,608,685.33,164.11%,8,-41.37%,2.05,-29.63%,55.31%,-12.78%,"14,568,894","-5,764,080",-28.35%,18,,,,,,,,,,

Lead Dog Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lead-dog-ventures,"Wayland, Massachusetts, United States",,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,"Lead Dog Ventures was founded by software industry veteran John Landry to provide today's early-stage technology companies the  intellectual, relationship and financial capital to become tomorrow's   ""Lead Dogs"".   After 25 years of building great software products and great software companies, Landry has had a distinguished track record as an innovative ""Serial CTO"", successfully creating and executing a business-aware technology vision at several major software companies.   His CTO career has evolved from developing batch mainframe application systems, to AI-based expert systems, to large-scale database systems and development tools, to PC applications, to client-server email and groupware systems, to interactive Internet systems, to creating IBMâ€™s cross-corporation Internet strategy and most recently mobile and distributed systems.   In all cases, Landry's innovations and technology strategy have resulted in achieving maximum value for investors and employees alike â€“ all of these companies (excluding IBM) were successfully acquired near the peak of their value.  This strategy has allowed Landry to capitalize on past work and then begin development on the ""next big thing"", a cycle he has repeated again and again -- seven times in the last 20 years! Aiming to make this experience available to others while still staying involved in the very latest technologies, Landry manages Lead Dog Ventures.  Lead Dog is a new-age technology business accelerator, drawing upon Landryâ€™s relevant technology business experience, a rich network of trusted and diverse professional relationships, as well as his access to sources of early stage investment capital.  Landry also serves on the Board of Directors of several of Lead Dog's private company investments. Landry balances this emerging company focus with frequent consulting and speaking engagements with the thought leaders of the ""big dogs"" -- IBM, McKinsey, Arthur Andersen, top-tier Venture Capital firms and several Fortune 500 clients.   By bridging these two worlds for nearly 25 years, Landry and Lead Dog Ventures provide both large and small companies alike unique access to knowledge, relationships and capital investment opportunities -- a combination designed to produce tomorrow's ""Lead Dogs"".",25,http://twitter.com/leaddog99,,,,Active,Lead Dog Ventures was founded by software industry veteran John Landry to provide today's early-stage technology companies the,,,,,,,,http://www.leaddog.com,info@leaddogventures.com,,,Angel Group,Seed,3,3,,,2,2,,,,"25,866",0.8,-0.1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,
