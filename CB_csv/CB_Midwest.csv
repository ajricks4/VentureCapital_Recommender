The typical OTAF investee is in the late “Seed”, “Start-up” or “Early” lifecycle stages – depending on the industry. We prefer software companies to have demonstrated commercial feasibility by revenue generation.

SaaS Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/saas-capital,"Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",,,"Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,"As the name suggests, SaaS Capital exclusively finances SaaS companies.  Their Committed Credit Facilities are specifically designed to fund the growth of a SaaS business in lieu of a round of equity. The company provides Committed Credit Facilities of $2 million to $15 million to SaaS companies with $200k and up in monthly recurring revenue (MRR). They understand the nuances of your business model and can get to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ quickly. If it’s a good mutual fit, they can usually originate a term sheet in about a week. Their Committed Credit Facilities provide SaaS companies with distinct advantages: Longer commitment and repayment periods (5+ years) during which your available capital can be drawn on for 2 years and the facility can then either be renewed or the debt amortized out over an additional 3 years; More capital: SaaS Capital makes available between 4x and 7x MRR to be drawn as needed. Since the available amount is a multiple of your MRR, total borrowable funds automatically increase as your revenue grows; Lower total interest expense -- compared to a term loan, cash is borrowed only as it is needed, thereby reducing total interest expense, and; Useable money -- no balance sheet covenants so you don’t end up borrowing your own money.  They also have over a decade of experience in the SaaS ecosystem to help portfolio companies succeed through: Knowledge transfer -- their portfolio company executives participate in exclusive forums and conference calls to share their experiences, challenges, and successes; Industry access -- they connect their companies with SaaS-specific advisors and later-stage investors as needed, and; Research and benchmarking data -- they publish original, data-driven research on SaaS-specific topics such as valuation, retention, growth, and marketing.",27,http://twitter.com/SaaSCapital,http://www.linkedin.com/company/saas-capital,http://www.facebook.com/Saas-Capital/206696409342251,,Active,Premier provider of alternative growth capital to growing SaaS companies.,2007-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.saas-capital.com,connect@saas-capital.com,,,Venture Debt,Debt,29,30,,27,7,7,,,,"8,339",-0.1,-0.1,-0.1,"12,514","12,817.74",-23.25%,85,40.83%,1.6,13.91%,78.07%,33.04%,"2,351,376","95,381",4.23%,35,,,12,,,,,,,

RSVP Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rsvp-capital,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States",,,"Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,"Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Adelaide, South Australia, RSVP brings more than 30 years of entrepreneurial management success and 10 years of dedicated, venture capital experience to bear on behalf of their portfolio companies. RSVP currently oversees an investment portfolio of over a dozen companies in the United States and Australia.    They’re successful entrepreneurs, CEOs and tech junkies that approach every investment as a team. They’ve been there before and know what it takes to evolve from startup to market success. Any investor can just throw money at your business, but what most startups need is a capital partner that commits as much sweat equity as they do dollars to your success. Led by their two founders, Paul Vlasic and Raymond Spencer, RSPV’s primary focus has leaned toward technology-based accelerators, green energy, and the health and sustainable living verticals. However, they are always drawn to any market disrupter regardless of industry because that’s where the real opportunities blossom. As experienced entrepreneurs theirselves, they know what it takes to drive innovation. They’re not interested in simply “running the numbers” or “doing deals.” Instead, they work tirelessly to support passionate entrepreneurs and guide their ideas into market-leading companies. RSVP Ventures finances early-stage and growth-stage companies meeting, at a minimum, all of the following criteria: - at least $1M in revenue - high gross margins - established leadership team - proven products with satisfied customers - an ability to scale rapidly - established co-investors - geographically located in the United States or Australia",,https://twitter.com/rsvpcapital,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rsvp-capital,,,Active,RSVP Capital is a venture capital firm specializing in investment of early stage companies.,2007-01-01,year,,,,,,http://rsvpcapital.com,info@rsvpcapital.com,734-237-3210,,Venture Capital,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",3,3,,,1,1,,,,"34,053",-0.4,-0.2,-0.4,122,141.74,60.46%,,,1,-66.67%,100%,100%,"30,383,383","564,775",1.89%,28,,,9,,,,,,,

By institutionalizing lessons learned from the Inc. 500 successes and applying those principles to the tech-transfer industry, the company properly addresses the needs and solves the inefficiencies of the current system. Using techniques prevalent amongst the fastest growing companies in the country, and then improving upon these based on real-world lessons, The Incubation Factory has successfully established two tranches of portfolio companies and is in the process of creating a third tranche. 1993 – 2003: TIF Tech Fund evolved from Anthony, Allan & Quinn, Inc. (“AAQ”) which was founded in 1993 by AAQ’s current CEO Dan Schmitt and two partners. AAQ successfully launched eight companies from 1993 to 2003, three of which grew rapidly enough to qualify for the Inc. 500 List of the Fastest Growing Private Companies in America. In 1997, recognizing a tremendous need and opportunity for streamlining back office claim processing for the healthcare industry, AAQ founded Advanced Business Fulfillment (“ABF”) to serve insurance companies, managed care organizations, HMOs and third-party administrators. By 2003, ABF ranked No. 23 nationally and No. 1 in Missouri on the Inc. 500 List. In July 2003, ABF was sold to publicly-traded WebMD for $260 million. Through this experience AAQ performed an in-depth study of their Inc. 500 peer group, analyzing what made these companies successful as well as why other companies fail. These findings created an opportunity to introduce a paradigm shift in the innovation process, as it was discovered that companies make the same mistakes and missed out on the same opportunities across industries and businesses.",,,http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-incubation-factory,,,Active,"The Incubation Factory has a nearly twenty-year history in identifying, accelerating, launching and governing early stage companies.",,,,,,,For Profit,http://theincubationfactory.com/,,314-450-5999,,Incubator,Seed,1,1,,,,,,,,"43,865",2.1,0.6,1.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,
