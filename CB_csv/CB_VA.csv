DARPA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/darpa,"Arlington, Virginia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was created with a national sense of urgency in February 1958 amidst one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the Cold War and the already-accelerating pace of technology. In the months preceding the official authorization for the agency's creation, Department of Defense Directive Number 5105.15, the Soviet Union had launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the world's second satellite, two months after Sputnik 1, resulted in a spectacular fiery failure. Finally, at the end of January 1958, a stunned United States became the second nation to place an object in orbit when it successfully launched the Explorer 1 satellite. Out of this traumatic experience of technological surprise in the first moments of the Space Age, U.S. leadership created DARPA, initially with the shorter name Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In the nearly 60 years since it was established, DARPA has owned the critical mission of keeping the United States out front when it comes to cultivating breakthrough technologies for national security rather than in a position of catching up to strategically important innovations and achievements of others. With no research and development facilities of its own, DARPA has become known as a laboratory and incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, technology challenges, research management, funding, and other cultural and infrastructural support elements that it takes to usher transformative ideas toward consequential new realities.","1,404",http://twitter.com/darpa,http://www.linkedin.com/company/darpa,http://www.facebook.com/DARPA,,Active,DARPA is a central research and development organization for the US Department of Defense.,1958-02-07,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.darpa.mil,employment@darpa.mil,(703) 526-6630,,Venture Capital,,18,20,,11,4,4,,,,"2,282",-1.3,-1.1,-0.5,"282,132","295,947.82",5.12%,127,-3.79%,2.53,-8.33%,62.84%,5.04%,"195,005","4,695",2.47%,19,,,8,3,1,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,Scientific and technological services,,,
Three Tree Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/three-tree-ventures,"Falls Church, Virginia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,"Shawn Carpenter is the Founder and Chairman of the Board at Three Tree Ventures, an early-stage technology startup investment fund that backs exceptional entrepreneurs that are applying technology to market segments with high caps that have had a historically incorrect, ineffective and/or insufficient level of technology application. Additionally, Three Tree Ventures prefers to invest in startups as early as possible, almost always only invests in product companies, and prefers to invest in organizations with one or more veteran founder(s). Shawn has also been an LP and Advisor to CrossCut Ventures (http://www.crosscut.vc/home) located in Los Angeles, CA, for over four years. Mr. Carpenter is a globally respected cyber security expert with a broad range of successful early-stage investments, including Compass, Privateer Holdings, Awake Security, GroupSense, White Ops, ThreatGRID (acquired by Cisco), RideScout (acquired by Daimler AG), InAuth (acquired by American Express) and Efflux Systems (acquired by NETSCOUT Systems). Mr. Carpenter is known for his acumen for advising early stage innovators. He has successfully helped raise capital, navigate rough waters, acquire key talent and customers, and help develop short and long-term strategies. He currently advises CrossCut Ventures, Trinity Cyber, TruSTAR Technology, Cybraics, AgentHero, GroupSense, uStadium and Netswitch Technology Management. He has held key positions at startups where he was an early employee — Principal Forensics Analyst at NetWitness, Chief Technical Analyst at iSIGHT, Chief Strategy Officer at Invotas, and Senior Vice President of Cyber at Cybraics. One of his passions is being the Technical Advisor for a non-profit 501(c)3 founded by his wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, and a close friend, Jessica Stern — Connect Our Kids (http://www.connectourkids.org). The organization is applying modern technologies like artificial intelligence and data science to the US foster care system to improve outcomes. His experience and successful entrepreneurial background (e.g. NetWitness, iSIGHT Partners, Invotas) are coupled with deep technical skills honed while pioneering cyber security protocols for the federal government and working at NetWitness and iSIGHT Partners over the past two decades. Shawn is also a veteran of the US Navy, and qualified as a nuclear operator and chemist during his six years of service in the US Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPS Class 9203). Shawn also worked as a senior cyber security analyst for almost six years as a Member of the Technical Staff (MTS) at Sandia National Laboratories. He discovered one of the first documented penetrations of US Government networks. After joining NetWitness as one of the first employees, he helped architect, implement and stand up the Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC) — at the time the largest deployment of NetWitness gear for a federal client. Mr. Carpenter also worked as a senior analyst at the US Department of State's Cyber Threat Analysis Team (CTAD) from 2004-2007; he was a key member of the 2005 CTAD team that was awarded the prestigious Frank B. Rowlett Trophy For Organizational Achievement by the National Security Agency. Shawn has been tinkering with computers since he bought his first computer, a TRS-80 Model I, in late 1978 at the age of 10. He has been curious about almost everything since he was born, and enjoys playing slide guitar, banjo and trumpet, metal detecting with his kids, climbing tall trees, building forts high in tall trees, lucid dreaming, experimenting with brain/machine interfaces, building robotic banshees, and hacking all of the things. Mr. Carpenter has a particular affection for blues and jazz, and is an investor in a John Coltrane biography — ""Chasing Trane"" (https://www.coltranefilm.com). His investments span everything from being the first money in at Rumi Spice (https://www.rumispice.com), a sustainable saffron growing enterprise founded by three West Point graduates that served in Herat, Afghanistan, that three years later is the largest private employer of Afghan women in the world, with over 2000 women employees. In May 2017, Mark Cuban became an investor in the saffron startup. In September of 2018, Rumi Spice's saffron became available nationwide in all Whole Food Markets. Shawn is a native of Sioux Falls, SD, and credits his Mother, South Dakota roots, and mentors and friends like Amit Yoran for his scrappiness and successes.",150,https://twitter.com/3TreeVentures,https://www.linkedin.com/company/9552323,https://www.facebook.com/threetreeventures/,,Active,Three Tree Ventures is an early stage VC firm that invests in startups that are applying technology to disrupt the market status quo.,2011-10-01,month,,,,,,http://www.threetreeventures.com,shawn@threetreeventures.com,,,Family Investment Office,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",19,20,,,4,4,,,,"3,008",-0.4,-0.3,6.2,162,143.98,,27,,4,,,,"22,296,696",,,13,,,,,,,,,,
