Revolution,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/revolution,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",,"Launched by [Steve Case](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-case) in 2005, Revolution seeks to transform whole market sectors by shifting power to consumers. Revolution looks for companies that are attacking large, traditional industries with innovative new products and services.  Revolution LLC has three core business groups: Revolution Ventures, Revolution Growth and Revolution Places. Many industries are on the brink of disruptive change: At Revolution they build insurgent companies to capitalize on nascent opportunities. Revolution searches for businesses that recognize emerging market trends and pursues them, taking risks and ultimately defining their industry. Revolution scouts for innovative new products and breakthrough ways of doing things that are currently undiscovered, under-financed, or undone–leaving consumers under-served. Revolution Ventures makes initial early-stage venture capital investments in companies, often in partnership with other top-tier investors, in amounts of less than $10 million.  Revolution typically leads early rounds of financing but will also follow other top-tier investors in companies they love with investment partners they trust and respect.  The firm is often involved as a Board member with a focus on strategy and developing a competitive position in the marketplace. The Revolution Ventures team looks at business concepts that match its experience and interests.  These tend to be big disruptive ideas that attack areas of the consumer space ripe for reinvention, which have the potential to rapidly scale.  Businesses they engage with typically come from the consumer tech sector, media, entertainment, or other mass-market opportunities that offer a unique approach to tackling a staid category and grow into a significant consumer business. The Revolution Growth team sees itself as business builders, not just investors. Its sweet spot is on technology-enabled businesses that empower consumers and disrupt existing, multi-billion dollar industries. Revolution Growth invests upwards of $20M in “speed-ups” – helping companies take ideas from niche to mass and scale to capitalize on huge market opportunities. The team is highly selective – typically investing significant amounts in only two or three new companies per year. They operate on a very hands-on basis and as a true partner, working relentlessly with management teams, over a long period of time, to help build their businesses. Revolution Places invests in unique real estate and hospitality opportunities, creating a new model for travel and tourism that promotes and encourages a healthy lifestyle and establishes a consumer brand that reflects those values. The team invests in differentiated properties that have significant long-term development potential and in lifestyle hospitality companies with the opportunity to scale.  Revolution Places’ typical investment is in the $25-50 million range, and it is usually the majority shareholder. Across all funds and business areas, Revolution’s philosophy is that “Consumers drive the changes in the marketplace; Revolution serves as the engine”.",483,http://twitter.com/Revolution,https://www.linkedin.com/company/revolution-llc/,,,Active,"Revolution is a venture capital firm based in Washington, DC.",2005-04-01,day,,,,,,http://www.revolution.com,,,,Venture Capital,"Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Seed",82,118,,42,20,20,,,,187,2.7,3.8,9.4,"35,772","38,172.38",71.71%,72,-30.22%,2.94,-15.02%,41.95%,1.67%,"980,838","-267,558",-21.43%,41,,,49,,,,,9619674,USD,9619674

What is the business model, how does the model work, what metrics do we care about, where are the bottlenecks? In general, what are the mechanics of growing a firm from a group of founders to a large company where we no longer know all the employees by name. In addition, we leverage our personal networks to provide additional expertise and recruiting support across all operations from technology and architecture to sales and marketing.

DARPA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/darpa,"Arlington, Virginia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was created with a national sense of urgency in February 1958 amidst one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the Cold War and the already-accelerating pace of technology. In the months preceding the official authorization for the agency's creation, Department of Defense Directive Number 5105.15, the Soviet Union had launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the world's second satellite, two months after Sputnik 1, resulted in a spectacular fiery failure. Finally, at the end of January 1958, a stunned United States became the second nation to place an object in orbit when it successfully launched the Explorer 1 satellite. Out of this traumatic experience of technological surprise in the first moments of the Space Age, U.S. leadership created DARPA, initially with the shorter name Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In the nearly 60 years since it was established, DARPA has owned the critical mission of keeping the United States out front when it comes to cultivating breakthrough technologies for national security rather than in a position of catching up to strategically important innovations and achievements of others. With no research and development facilities of its own, DARPA has become known as a laboratory and incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, technology challenges, research management, funding, and other cultural and infrastructural support elements that it takes to usher transformative ideas toward consequential new realities.","1,404",http://twitter.com/darpa,http://www.linkedin.com/company/darpa,http://www.facebook.com/DARPA,,Active,DARPA is a central research and development organization for the US Department of Defense.,1958-02-07,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.darpa.mil,employment@darpa.mil,(703) 526-6630,,Venture Capital,,18,20,,11,4,4,,,,"2,282",-1.3,-1.1,-0.5,"282,132","295,947.82",5.12%,127,-3.79%,2.53,-8.33%,62.84%,5.04%,"195,005","4,695",2.47%,19,,,8,3,1,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,Scientific and technological services,,,
Three Tree Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/three-tree-ventures,"Falls Church, Virginia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,"Shawn Carpenter is the Founder and Chairman of the Board at Three Tree Ventures, an early-stage technology startup investment fund that backs exceptional entrepreneurs that are applying technology to market segments with high caps that have had a historically incorrect, ineffective and/or insufficient level of technology application. Additionally, Three Tree Ventures prefers to invest in startups as early as possible, almost always only invests in product companies, and prefers to invest in organizations with one or more veteran founder(s). Shawn has also been an LP and Advisor to CrossCut Ventures (http://www.crosscut.vc/home) located in Los Angeles, CA, for over four years. Mr. Carpenter is a globally respected cyber security expert with a broad range of successful early-stage investments, including Compass, Privateer Holdings, Awake Security, GroupSense, White Ops, ThreatGRID (acquired by Cisco), RideScout (acquired by Daimler AG), InAuth (acquired by American Express) and Efflux Systems (acquired by NETSCOUT Systems). Mr. Carpenter is known for his acumen for advising early stage innovators. He has successfully helped raise capital, navigate rough waters, acquire key talent and customers, and help develop short and long-term strategies. He currently advises CrossCut Ventures, Trinity Cyber, TruSTAR Technology, Cybraics, AgentHero, GroupSense, uStadium and Netswitch Technology Management. He has held key positions at startups where he was an early employee — Principal Forensics Analyst at NetWitness, Chief Technical Analyst at iSIGHT, Chief Strategy Officer at Invotas, and Senior Vice President of Cyber at Cybraics. One of his passions is being the Technical Advisor for a non-profit 501(c)3 founded by his wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, and a close friend, Jessica Stern — Connect Our Kids (http://www.connectourkids.org). The organization is applying modern technologies like artificial intelligence and data science to the US foster care system to improve outcomes. His experience and successful entrepreneurial background (e.g. NetWitness, iSIGHT Partners, Invotas) are coupled with deep technical skills honed while pioneering cyber security protocols for the federal government and working at NetWitness and iSIGHT Partners over the past two decades. Shawn is also a veteran of the US Navy, and qualified as a nuclear operator and chemist during his six years of service in the US Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPS Class 9203). Shawn also worked as a senior cyber security analyst for almost six years as a Member of the Technical Staff (MTS) at Sandia National Laboratories. He discovered one of the first documented penetrations of US Government networks. After joining NetWitness as one of the first employees, he helped architect, implement and stand up the Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC) — at the time the largest deployment of NetWitness gear for a federal client. Mr. Carpenter also worked as a senior analyst at the US Department of State's Cyber Threat Analysis Team (CTAD) from 2004-2007; he was a key member of the 2005 CTAD team that was awarded the prestigious Frank B. Rowlett Trophy For Organizational Achievement by the National Security Agency. Shawn has been tinkering with computers since he bought his first computer, a TRS-80 Model I, in late 1978 at the age of 10. He has been curious about almost everything since he was born, and enjoys playing slide guitar, banjo and trumpet, metal detecting with his kids, climbing tall trees, building forts high in tall trees, lucid dreaming, experimenting with brain/machine interfaces, building robotic banshees, and hacking all of the things. Mr. Carpenter has a particular affection for blues and jazz, and is an investor in a John Coltrane biography — ""Chasing Trane"" (https://www.coltranefilm.com). His investments span everything from being the first money in at Rumi Spice (https://www.rumispice.com), a sustainable saffron growing enterprise founded by three West Point graduates that served in Herat, Afghanistan, that three years later is the largest private employer of Afghan women in the world, with over 2000 women employees. In May 2017, Mark Cuban became an investor in the saffron startup. In September of 2018, Rumi Spice's saffron became available nationwide in all Whole Food Markets. Shawn is a native of Sioux Falls, SD, and credits his Mother, South Dakota roots, and mentors and friends like Amit Yoran for his scrappiness and successes.",150,https://twitter.com/3TreeVentures,https://www.linkedin.com/company/9552323,https://www.facebook.com/threetreeventures/,,Active,Three Tree Ventures is an early stage VC firm that invests in startups that are applying technology to disrupt the market status quo.,2011-10-01,month,,,,,,http://www.threetreeventures.com,shawn@threetreeventures.com,,,Family Investment Office,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",19,20,,,4,4,,,,"3,008",-0.4,-0.3,6.2,162,143.98,,27,,4,,,,"22,296,696",,,13,,,,,,,,,,

NASA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasa,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",,"NASA's vision is to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner. Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.","39,082",http://twitter.com/nasa,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2003,http://www.facebook.com/NASA,,Active,"NASA is responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.",1958-07-29,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.nasa.gov/,public-inquiries@hq.nasa.gov,(202) 358-0001,,Venture Capital,Early Stage Venture,17,19,,13,2,2,,,,"2,290",-0.9,4.3,6.2,"35,487,921","34,772,413.05",7.75%,191,-3.25%,4.06,6.4%,55.03%,-0.02%,"1,342",-122,-8.33%,18,68,"84,888",322,2,0,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,,41594,USD,41594

U.S. Small Business Administration,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/u-s-small-business-administration,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",,"The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the federal government to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation. We recognize that small business is critical to our economic recovery and strength, to building America's future, and to helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace. Although SBA has grown and evolved in the years since it was established in 1953, the bottom line mission remains the same. The SBA helps Americans start, build and grow businesses. Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Overview & History Since its founding on July 30, 1953, the U.S. Small Business Administration has delivered millions of loans, loan guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions and other forms of assistance to small businesses. The SBA was officially established in 1953, but its philosophy and mission began to take shape years earlier in a number of predecessor agencies, largely as a response to the pressures of the Great Depression and World War II. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), created by President Herbert Hoover in 1932 to alleviate the financial crisis of the Great Depression, was SBA's grandparent.  The RFC was basically a federal lending program for all businesses hurt by the Depression, large and small.  It was adopted as the personal project of Hoover's successor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was staffed by some of Roosevelt's most capable and dedicated workers. Concern for small business intensified during World War II, when large industries beefed up production to accommodate wartime defense contracts and smaller businesses were left unable to compete.  To help small business participate in war production and give them financial viability, Congress created the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) in 1942.  The SWPC provided direct loans to private entrepreneurs, encouraged large financial institutions to make credit available to small enterprises, and advocated small business interests to federal procurement agencies and big businesses. The SWPC was dissolved after the war, and its lending and contract powers were handed over to the RFC.  At this time, the Office of Small Business (OSB) in the Department of Commerce also assumed some responsibilities that would later become characteristic duties of the SBA. Its services were primarily educational.  Believing that a lack of information and expertise was the main cause of small business failure, the OSB produced brochures and conducted management counseling for individual entrepreneurs. Congress created another wartime organization to handle small business concerns during the Korean War, this time called the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA).  Its functions were similar to those of the SWPC, except that ultimate lending authority was retained by the RFC. The SDPA certified small businesses to the RFC when it had determined the businesses to be competent to perform the work of government contracts. By 1952, a move was on to abolish the RFC. To continue the important functions of the earlier agencies, President Dwight Eisenhower proposed creation of a new small business agency -- the Small Business Administration (SBA). In the Small Business Act of July 30, 1953, Congress created the Small Business Administration, whose function was to ""aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns."" The charter also stipulated that the SBA would ensure small businesses a ""fair proportion"" of government contracts and sales of surplus property. By 1954, SBA already was making direct business loans and guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses, as well as making loans to victims of natural disasters, working to get government procurement contracts for small businesses and helping business owners with management and technical assistance and business training. The Investment Company Act of 1958 established the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program, under which SBA licensed, regulated and helped provide funds for privately owned and operated venture capital investment firms. They specialized in providing long-term debt and equity investments to high-risk small businesses. Its creation was the result of a Federal Reserve study that discovered, in the simplest terms, that small businesses could not get the credit they needed to keep pace with technological advancement. In 1964, SBA began to attack poverty through the Equal Opportunity Loan (EOL) Program. The EOL Program relaxed the credit and collateral requirements for applicants living below the poverty level in an effort to encourage new businesses that had been unable to attract financial backing, but were nevertheless sound commercial initiatives. SBA has grown in terms of total assistance provided and its array of programs tailored to encourage small enterprises in all areas.  SBA's programs now include financial and federal contract procurement assistance, management assistance, and specialized outreach to women, minorities and armed forces veterans. The SBA also provides loans to victims of natural disasters and specialized advice and assistance in international trade.",548,http://twitter.com/sbagov,http://www.linkedin.com/company/us-small-business-administration,http://www.facebook.com/SBAgov,,Active,U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the federal government to aid.,1953-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.sba.gov,answerdesk@sba.gov,(800) 827-5722,,Government Office,,7,8,,3,1,1,,,,"14,825",-0.1,-0.2,0,"1,285,031","1,358,178.53",2.56%,212,9.44%,4.49,4.55%,56.5%,0.2%,"42,876",-786,-1.8%,71,,,28,,,,,,,

The President and Vice President are elected as running mates by the Electoral College, for which each state, as well as the District of Columbia, is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in both houses of Congress.

NIST Advanced Technology Program,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nist-advanced-technology-program,"Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States",,,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,"ATP improves the quality of life of Americans in the 21st century by investing in early-stage, innovative technologies. The pace of technological change is faster than ever before in today’s global economy, and competitive advanced technologies are critical to national economic growth. Private-sector investments in research and development are mainly focused on incremental improvements to capture faster returns to companies and their shareholders. Few financial institutions, venture capitalists, and angel investors fund unproven, early-stage technologies. This strategy, however, erodes the groundwork for game-changing advances that are key to creating new capabilities, improving productivity, and ensuring growth. This is where ATP comes in. ATP helps industry invest in longer-term, high risk research with payoffs far beyond private profit. By sharing the cost with companies, ATP accelerates the development of early-stage, innovative technologies, helping industry raise its competitive potential while providing Americans with a higher standard of living.",,https://www.twitter.com/usnistgov,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nist,https://www.facebook.com/usnistgov,,Active,A United States government program designed to stimulate early-stage advanced technology development,,,,,,,,http://www.atp.nist.gov/,do-webmaster@nist.gov,(301) 975-2762,,Venture Capital,,1,1,,,1,1,,,,"81,588",-0.3,1.9,1.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
