Bullpen Capital  is an early-stage venture fund being formed to make follow-on investments in Internet technology companies that have been initially funded by super-angel capital efficient funds.  Extending the capital efficient model beyond the seed stage keeps options open for the founders and investors.  The rise of the super-angels is a capital market response to a new technology trend: the rise of the lean venture, typically an Internet service deploying fast-to-market technology which enables rapid market validation before large capital requirements. The super-angels are emerging as a natural response to a decades long over-sizing of venture firms, built more to fund the semiconductor factories of the past than Internet firms of today. Bullpen works with its super-angel partners to: - Extend a seed round to give a start-up more time to prove itself - Fund a company requiring more early money than the usual seed deal - Restart a company that is a â€œfallen angelâ€ but still has great promise - Fund a â€œrising starâ€ needing a small B round it before it goes to VC auction The lean model does not depend on the lightning strike of finding the rocket-ship that is immediately successful after its seed round.  Almost every rocket-ship has a rocky start, requiring post-seed nurturing before ascending.  This usually entails one or more â€œpivotsâ€, in which a companyâ€:tm:s basic direction must be changed to find its market.  These changes are wrenching, and require additional capital before proof points are met.

Their areas of expertise include small molecule and protein therapeutics; medical devices; diagnostics; and technologies that facilitate drug discovery and life science research. They all have MD or PhD degrees, and hands-on operating experience in various start-up healthcare companies that later went public. As a result, they are known for the value they offer their companies, as board members and shareholders. They are also known for being fundamental, extremely patient investors. The days when momentum investing drove the public biotechnology markets are long gone, and they are glad that they are. The public markets demand data, not dreams. As a result, it is data that drives their decision process. In considering a new investment, they focus on whether there is adequate proof of principle to believe that the company's products will work. In therapeutics, for example, they look closely at whether the biochemistry, animal models and any human data make it more probable than average that the product will eventually prove to have an important therapeutic benefit. The size of the potential market and the quality of the management or founding team are critical in their evaluation as well. Skyline Ventures are value and return driven, more than driven by the stage of the investment. Most often they lead or co-lead a company's first or second institutional venture round, but have previously helped found companies and invested in PIPEs and leveraged buyouts. In October 2007, they completed raising Skyline V, which has $350 million in committed capital. They have approximately $800 million under management.

Seraph Group,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/seraph-group,"Foster City, California, United States",,,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,"It all began in 2003, with a conversation outlining the inefficiencies in Angel investing in addition to the difficulties entrepreneurs face while raising start-up capital. Few investment groups specialize in investing $50k to $2 million in early-stage companies and even fewer bring a broad value-add network to support entrepreneurs. The Seraph Investor Network was founded with the vision of providing capital and support  in an expedient and efficient manner without geographic prejudice. Our Investor Network reaches 91+ cities and spans three continents. The reach provides valuable expertise to entrepreneurs and investors. Seraph Group is comprised of a diverse group of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technology leaders across wide array of different industries. By leveraging this expertise, Seraph Group is able to evaluate and invest in venture scalable opportunities across most industries. Investments range from $50K to $1.5 million and can participate along any financing stage of the company. While Seraph Group is comprised solely of angel investors, the investment process mimics a traditional venture capital firm where there is a fund managed by a small investment team. This pool of smart capital brings singular access to a prestigious group of individuals that are all invested in an entrepreneur's business and its success. In today' market, companies have proven that only a relatively small amount of capital infusion, under $1 million, is enough to build a venture scalable business. However, most entrepreneurs will attest, that raising $500K to $1.5 million, is the hardest amount of capital to raise because it is too small for traditional venture firms. Seraph Group's focus is to fill this unmet need in the market for professional, smart capital. The primary investment criteria for companies raising money is for it to be a venture-scalable business and not a life-style business. Seraph Group will consider investing in any round of financing and has often invested alongside later-stage venture firms.",59,http://twitter.com/SeraphGroup,http://www.linkedin.com/company/seraph-group,,,Active,"Seraph Group is an angel investor that invests between $50,000 and $1,000,000 in early-stage startups.",2005-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.seraphgroup.net,,,,Angel Group,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",34,43,,7,12,12,,,,"3,932",-0.4,1.4,5.3,636,895.08,-40.18%,155,-11.63%,4.33,40.46%,52.56%,29.02%,"11,805,984","1,895,815",19.13%,20,,,11,,,,,,,

They all share an overarching set of values and themes around the people, the idea, and the impact. The People: first and foremost we invest in people. This includes the entrepreneur, their team, board and others who are behind them to succeed. The trustworthiness, experience, commitment level, and entrepreneurial ability of the people involved are probably the most important factors we look to evaluate. The Idea: we’re concerned with the relative importance of an idea, whether it matters, and if the organization can pull it off. How does the idea compare to other interventions in terms of its cost, scaleability, and impact? We’d like to know how the idea leads advances a larger vision. The Impact: we’d like to know what success looks like, and how the organization knows it’s being achieved. What are the implications of achieving success? Does it mean that dozens, thousands, or millions of lives will experience lasting changes for the better? As a funder willing to take risks, we also have an appreciation for things that cannot yet be measured, but hold the promise of great impact.",,http://twitter.com/peeryfoundation,http://www.linkedin.com/company/peery-foundation,http://www.facebook.com/peeryfoundation,,Active,The Peery Foundation primarily invests in early to mid-stage social entrepreneurs who are effectively addressing the issues of poverty.,1978-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.peeryfoundation.org,,650-644-4660,,Venture Capital,Grant,8,35,,1,,,,,,"17,209",0,1,3.2,"1,868","1,224.34",-5.07%,129,2.83%,2.9,6.6%,32.96%,1.29%,"7,811,302","549,224",7.56%,14,,,,,,,,,,

Led by CEO Sally Osberg since 2001, their mission is to drive large scale change by investing in, connecting and celebrating social entrepreneurs and the innovators who help them solve the world’s most pressing problems. Social entrepreneurs are society’s change agents, creators of innovations that disrupt the status quo and transform our world for the better. By identifying the people and programs already bringing positive change around the world, we empower them to extend their reach, deepen their impact and fundamentally improve society.  The Skoll Foundation is now one of the leading foundations in the field of social entrepreneurship. Over the past 14 years, they have awarded approximately $413 million, including investments in 108 remarkable social entrepreneurs and 87 organizations on five continents who are creating a brighter future for underserved communities. In addition to these investments, we fund a $25 million portfolio of program-related investments (PRIs).  In 2003, they partnered with the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford to launch the first academic center dedicated to social entrepreneurship, the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship.  They also support and partner with many pioneers and innovators in the field, organizations such as Ashoka, Acumen Fund and Duke University’s Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship. As the field has matured and they entered their second decade, they are focusing our strategy.

These â€˜venture loansâ€™ generally include fees and interest expense like most loans, but also include an equity component (such as warrants) to compensate for the higher risk.",7,http://twitter.com/montagecapital,http://www.linkedin.com/company/montage-capital,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Montage-Capital/579322988795619,,Active,Montage Capital represents a new breed of financial partner for growing businesses.

Their mission has always been to help their customers achieve what matters most to them. In 1993, they shipped their first data storage system to Patrick Mulrooney, who at that time was a system administrator at Tandem Computers. The network appliance was designed to clean up his infrastructure sprawl. He loved its simplicity. “Patrick’s favorite attribute was that their system rebooted in 30 seconds instead of hours like their competitors,” says NetApp co-founder, Dave Hitz. “While solving his downtime problem, they also gave Patrick a competitive edge.” More than 20 years later, their story is still about delivering innovation that gives their customers an edge over their competitors. From the edge of the universe with CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, to the edge of human endurance in Formula One auto racing, they help you do things you couldn’t before—at speeds you never thought possible. Throughout the world, leading organizations count on NetApp for software, systems, and services to manage and store their data. They help enterprises and service providers envision, deploy, and evolve their IT environments. Customers also benefit from their open collaboration with other technology leaders to create the specific solutions they need.  their team is passionate about customer success. Their company culture and work environment support that dedication. Together with their global network of partners, they are united in one goal: to help their customers achieve the outcomes that matter most to them. They view their culture as a competitive advantage and a foundation for continued success. They proudly hire the world’s most talented and committed employees, who work hard to help their customers, partners, shareholders, and communities thrive. Their commitment to their values results in an award-winning culture of collaboration and trust. The Great Place to Work Institute recently named NetApp #4 on its ""World's Best Multinational Workplaces 2015"" - the world's first annual study of multinational workplace excellence. They have repeatedly earned a spot on FORTUNE magazine's list of the ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" in the United States, as well as top spots on ""Great Place to Work"" lists in locations around the world. Their operational philosophy and culture are defined by their commitment to delivering the best possible results for the communities they serve. At NetApp, they take pride in living a set of shared core values: trust and integrity, leadership, simplicity, adaptability, teamwork and synergy, go beyond, get things done. Since their beginning in 1992, they have been delivering technology and product firsts with one goal in mind: the success of their customers.

Peakview Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peakview-capital,"Palo Alto, California, United States",,,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,"Peakview Capital represents a new generation of Silicon Valley venture capital, providing investors with both access to the industry’s elite VC funds and direct access to their highest-growth technology companies.    Peakview was founded with an insider’s view that US venture capital has changed.  The industry has reached a stage of maturity where top name VCs consistently access the best early stage companies, and have significant control over their financings.  Entrepreneurs know that having brand name VCs can increase their company value, and the top VCs have parlayed this into a control position.    This has created the situation where much of the industry’s investment returns are concentrated among the leading 20-30 firms.  These VCs double down on their fastest-growing companies, control the financings, and keep the highest returns within their LP ecosystem.  While these VCs fairly consistently outperform, and occasionally have blowout funds, the rest of the industry is hit-or-miss, and most VCs underperform public market indices.  Further, LP demand for these firms is so high that their funds are over-subscribed and new LPs are rarely admitted.    Peakview Capital takes advantage of this model, and creates high and stable returns for its investors through both fund investing and direct co-investment. Peakview manages a small fund of funds (soon raising Fund IV) that is highly concentrated in the “best of the best” VCs, and offers the fund to its LPs at relatively low fees and carry. Rather than being a traditional fund manager, access to the leading VCs is courtesy of the Peakview partners’ personal relationships, and experience as long-time VCs themselves.     Peakview then leverages these personal relationships, now formalized with LP status, to invest directly into the fastest-growing companies in the VCs’ portfolios.  Unlike a typical LP co-investment model, where LP investments can self-select into companies that “need” capital, Peakview targets the most attractive companies and leverages its VC experience and relationships to proactively invest in these portfolio winners.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/peakview-capital/,,,Active,Peakview Capital represents a new generation of Silicon Valley venture capital,2013-01-01,year,,,,,,http://www.peakview.capital/,info@peakview.capital,1 650 321 6600,,Fund Of Funds,Private Equity,5,5,,,,,,,,"12,707",0.1,0.3,-0.5,176,189.69,7.26%,142,,4,300%,0%,-100%,"21,616,247","-6,477,348",-23.06%,22,,,6,,,,,,,
