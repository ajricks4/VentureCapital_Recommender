Founded in 2008, betaworks is a company of builders.  A tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, products and data brought together in imaginative ways to build out a more connected world. At first glance we seem to do many things. But first and foremost, we're builders, seeking to create a more sustainable innovation model. The more we build, the more we learn, the more we get ideas for peripheral things, all related, connected -- in a loosely coupled network of products and companies.    betaworks is structured as a company-- a single company that owns larger pieces of the things it has built and smaller pieces of the things it has invested in. It operates as a network: a tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, and data united to build out a more inspired and useful connected world.  betaworks makes seed-stage investments in this ecosystem. To us, seed investing means ""first money in."" Our typical investment size is $150,000-200,000. We always invest as part of a syndicate of angels and early stage VCs.   Our requirements from an investment perspective are simple, though narrow. Investments must be early stage, heavily tech focused, and have a working (public or private) prototype. We are a powerpoint-free zone. We build and work closely with companies that we view as core to our vision, examples include: [Summize/Twitter Search](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/summize/),  [bitly](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitly-2),  [TweetDeck](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tweetdeck), [Chartbeat](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chartbeat).

High-value data, and its infrastructure, creates defensible companies with lower costs of scaling. We typically invest in the “early growth” stage of a company – when there is some revenue and signs of product/market fit, but it is not yet a consensus bet. We like this stage because we excel at driving momentum through targeted BD support, crafting platform strategies powered by core data assets, and preparing a company for growth financing.  Our hands-on GPs have a unique ability to identify, underwrite, and support businesses built around high-value data. Our team's experience – working together in this space since 2013 – brings differentiated insights into how data can be leveraged to create value.

MVP differentiates itself through its unique research and ability to streamline the transaction process by providing a one-stop principal investing and advisory solution to private companies and their various shareholders, as well as GPs and LPs. The firm accomplishes this by bringing together the full expertise of both their private equity and investment banking platforms in partnership with their research team. MVP maintains an extensive global network of family office, hedge fund, private equity, sovereign and private banking investors seeking access to this asset class.   MVP’s research arm, Manhattan Venture Research (“MVR”), is led by Santosh Rao, who was the first analyst to produce research on private technology companies. MVR provides insight for investors in the form of unbiased and cutting-edge private company reports that help alleviate the opacity and informational asymmetry inherent to the venture capital asset class. The team typically publishes at least four company-specific reports and two macro reports per year. Historical reports include Postmates, Slack, Uber, Palantir, and Airbnb. MVR also publishes Venture Bytes, a monthly newsletter, which includes its proprietary Liquidity Watchlist projecting the 25 companies most likely to go public. MVP manages all aspects of the transaction by managing communication with the buyer, seller, counsel and the company, therefore facilitating an efficient, transparent, issuer-friendly and U.S. regulatory compliant transaction.

Our Mission is to identify, vet and fund good, innovative ideas and provide all necessary resources, mentoring and hands-on assistance to entrepreneurs to help them launch successful businesses. RSV has its focus on identifying and bolstering opportunities in the Russian hi-tech sector, sourced from national scientific research, academic and entrepreneurial community.It’s well known that along with the wealth of intellectual prowess and technological experience, there is a dearth of entrepreneurial expertise in Russia. Our goal is to help fill that gap.Young startups require much more than just money to get their ideas off the ground. More than anything else young entrepreneurs are in need of advice, guidance and hands-on participation of knowledgeable and experienced mentors. This is a critical point in our program – we provide our participants with unfettered access to a network of mentors from day one of the program. Our mentors come from different backgrounds – they are successful businessmen, top technology experts, serial entrepreneurs, distinguished members of academia and professional advisors. An incubator environment can provide all necessary and expensive infrastructures needed for the company to operate. However nothing improves young startup chances for success more than a mentor capable of providing the team with guidance and advice based on the specific needs of the business. In things small, like choosing a name, to critical issues of formulating its business objectives, selecting a viable business model and prepare a business plan. And that’s not all; our mentorship program doesn’t end there. One of the most important things we do is helping our startups find investors and potential acquirers and successfully deal with them. It goes beyond making introductions, we work with our startups on honing their pitch, teaching them what to do to get investors interested in the company and how to close a deal once it’s on the table.",,,,,,Active,RSV Venture Partners is an early stage venture fund and a mentorship-driven startup incubator.,,,,,,,,http://www.rsvcapital.com,,,,Incubator,Seed,12,13,,,,,,,,"20,012",1.6,0.7,3.2,,165.16,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,

The firm was founded in 2000 by former Soros Fund Management partners who had worked together since 1995 and possess on average over 20 years’ investment experience in the Asia Pacific region. In the aggregate Indus manages approximately US$6.2 billion for a diverse client base of over 300 investors, including foundations and university endowments, corporate and public pensions, high net worth individuals, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and financial institutions. Indus currently offers the following investment strategies: Indus Asia Pacific Fund, Indus Japan Fund, Indus Pacific Opportunities Fund, Indus Omni Fund, Indus Select Fund, Indus Japan Long Only Fund, and Indus Emerging Markets Strategies.

The firm currently has over 85 employees, over a third of whom are investment and trading professionals. A geographical spread of investment professionals, both within and outside the markets in which Indus invests, facilitates intensive research and engenders a dispassionate approach to investment.   Indus aims to deliver high risk-adjusted annual returns throughout the investment cycle, capturing most of the upside in strong markets and preserving capital in difficult markets. Indus believes that stock picking based on rigorous fundamental analysis helps to generate positive returns over time. The investment team applies intensive analysis and research to exploit the inherent inefficiency of the markets in which it operates. Indus seeks to identify mispriced investment opportunities, and select uncorrelated and liquid investments that are chosen for their potential to generate alpha. Portfolio construction strategies endeavor to dampen the impact of market volatility. Risk management is an integral part of the firm’s investment philosophy, and involves both systems and culture.

Davis founded Davis Advisors in 1969. Mr. Davis had already built an auspicious career at The Bank of New York, where he rose to become the head of research and was named the youngest Vice President in the history of The Bank since Alexander Hamilton. During his tenure as principal Portfolio Manager for Davis Advisors, Shelby M.C. Davis created one of the most distinguished track records of any manager on Wall Street, navigating the flagship U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy effectively through a wide variety of market and economic conditions. Christopher C. Davis, our founder’s son, joined Davis Advisors in 1989 as a research analyst and rose to assume the roles of Portfolio Manager and head of research in the mid-1990s. Under Mr. Davis’s leadership the firm deepened and broadened its research effort, continuing the tradition of managing U.S. Large Cap Equities and expanding into U.S. All-Cap, International and Global Equities as well.
