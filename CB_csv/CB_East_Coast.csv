Simon School Venture Fund,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/simon-school-venture-capital-fund,"Rochester, New York, United States",,,"Great Lakes, East Coast, Northeastern US",,"Overview The Simon School Venture Fund (SSVF) is an evergreen fund managed by 2nd-year MBA students at the Simon Business School, University of Rochester. The Fund, initially capitalized by alumni donations, is guided by a Board of Directors consisting of successful entrepreneurs, VC investors, and accomplished professionals in other fields. Mission The SSVF provides a unique experiential educational opportunity for graduate level business students interested in entrepreneurship and venture investing. Student Analysts, Sr. Analysts, and Managers interact directly with entrepreneurs seeking investment, perform due diligence analysis, pitch and defend potential deals to Board members, participate in investment decisions, and are responsible for ongoing portfolio monitoring and management. Direct participation in Fund activities, operations, and management allows students to utilize and build on the skills learned in business school to produce cohesive, comprehensive, and well-reasoned analyses of potential deals - with the end goal of making sound investment decisions.  Why the Simon School Venture Fund? The SSVF leverages the capabilities of other Simon Business School student organizations and the University of Rochester's vast resources and alumni network to assist with portfolio company development. In addition to funding, SSVF’s portfolio companies can benefit from an exchange of business skills/services for real-world project experience. Whenever possible, we try to utilize available business student teams to work on ad-hoc projects that would benefit the company but may be too costly to hire out, or too time consuming for busy management teams that are already spread thin. In addition and when appropriate, we may also make valuable warm introductions to others in our extensive network to assist with other aspects of business development.

Their goal is to use their operational and financial expertise to position high quality brands for accelerated growth. Their team has over 75 years of franchise experience from single store operations to public company management. Collectively, the team has been involved in 20 brands including top global brands such as Popeyes, Burger King, Snap Fitness and Domino's as well as regional brands such as Moe's Southwest Grill, Pet Valu, Super Wash and local startups such as Urban Grounds and Tutor Force.

Their program is six months of high-intensity action designed for one thing: to quickly propel a choice group of promising startups into the market. If you qualify, they’ll provide you with seed capital (up to $24,000 per team), top-shelf mentoring and support, and a wealth of resources to give your venture the fuel it needs — all for a 6% equity stake. They’re focused on building real, sustainable businesses with the potential to scale. Their philosophy is simple — great companies can stand on their own two feet. If this sound interesting to you, they’d love to hear from you — you can apply now or contact us. They’re looking for talented teams with bright ideas in large, growing markets where access to the right resources can make a huge difference in a few months’ time. Although they’re targeting technology-based ventures, they know that scalable businesses come in all shapes and sizes. So if you’re tech, bring it on. If you’re the next great thing in web, bring it on. If you have a fantastic consumer product concept, bring it on! Don’t know if you fit? Reach out to us — they’d love to hear your idea. You must be coachable, committed, and willing to take on “co-pilots” for the duration of the program. You must also be willing to relocate to the Columbia, SC area for the 3-6 month program and dedicate 100% of your time to launching your venture. Why? Because that’s your skin in the game. There’s no commitment to staying in South Carolina at the end, but they think you’re going to like what you see. Columbia’s “Famously Hot” slogan doesn’t just talk about the weather. In the past 10 years, Columbia has fostered an environment for successful startup companies. Don’t just take their word for it, Kiplinger named Columbia the 5th best place to live in the US. As a capital city and home of the University of South Carolina, the state’s flagship university, Columbia has an abundance of resources dedicated to increasing entrepreneurial support. Various groups focus on entrepreneurial networking, programming, and resource management including a cowork, incubator, and nonprofit organizations. In 2013, Inc Magazine named their incubator one of the “Top Three College-Town Incubators to Watch.” It caters to over 50 affiliated companies and graduates. Startup communities gain a fillip from existing large enterprises providing the backbone and support. The large insurance sector led by BlueCross-BlueShield, Colonial Life, and several specialized companies are in the forefront. Prysmian Group, the world’s largest fibre optic manufacture is headquartered in the area. Unitrends, Digital Smiths, Collexis, DMI, Ometric and several successful technology companies in the recent years have laid a strong foundation to the startup story in the area. Expanding the knowledge economy, larger companies share their experiences and support fledgling innovators who aspire to mirror their success. Companies such as IDV (Speedtree), who develop SFX in motion pictures and games (8 major motion pictures including Avatar), and Bridge to Life, whose technology significantly enhances the lifespan of organs during transplant process, encourage others with their success. Several of Inc’s 500/5000 listed company leaders from the area have actively participated in helping the startup community. A unique mix of historical and modern create the rich history of Columbia. Through infusing southern hospitality with innovative technology, entrepreneurs in Columbia utilize the resources available to them to create a thriving, and growing, startup community.",,http://twitter.com/firedUPco,,,,Active,"FiredUp is six months top-shelf mentoring, community support, and a wealth of resources to launch your company.",,,,,,,,http://firedup.co/,,,,Accelerator,,2,2,,,,,,,24,"40,699",3,0,-0.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,

When more financial resources are required we can introduce the management to the most respected venture capital companies in the world. Our past experience has involved investments with Sequoia Capital, Menlo Ventures, Brentwood, Mohr Davidow Ventures, Polaris Ventures, and others. We have close relationships with these firms.
