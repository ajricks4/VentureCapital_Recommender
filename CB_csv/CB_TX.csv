It was founded in 2000 by Austin M. Long, III, who continues to lead the firm today, and Craig J. Nickels, who is now the Director of Private Equity at Washington University in St. Louis. ACG provides strategic advisory services to institutional investors in private equity. The firm is uniquely qualified, with a growing portfolio of patents relating to proprietary analytical methods; an expanding array of original research, including publications in peer-reviewed journals; and over 20 years of experience in managing or advising the private equity portfolios of large public funds. Alignment Capital was founded on the fundamental principle of alignment of interests. The firm believes that private equity is an asset class in which avoiding conflicts of interest between and among investors, intermediaries and investment managers is crucial to the success of all. ACG has become a strategic consultancy, as opposed to the combination consultancyâ€“asset management operation that is typical in the industry, in order to avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in advising plan sponsors on portfolio management issues while simultaneously managing portfolios of private equity investments. The firmâ€™s advisory approach is a balance between quantitative analysis and qualitative knowledge and experience. It combines the lessons learned from managing and advising large private equity portfolios with those gleaned from studying the behavior of private equity from a portfolio management perspective to assist clients in making optimal investment decisions. In short, ACG strives to bring clarity and rigorous, repeatable analysis to an area historically known for its informality and lack of transparency.

FLIP.Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flip-ventures,"Dallas, Texas, United States",,,"Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Southern US",,"A new startup investment model - Forward Looking Intellectual Property Ventures (FLIP.Ventures). When funding a new tech idea or startup there are never better odds than 50/50.  The idea will simply take hold or it won’t.  However, if one looks at startups as whole, industry reports show 90% of them fail.  Even though the 1-in-10 odds can pay off handsomely, all investing requires a strategy to beat the odds of failure and losses. At FLIP.Ventures we defy the odds.  We are a very unique, one of a kind, startup investment syndication strategy.  For example:  What if a startup secured $5 million in funding, then ran out of money, stopped operating and then EXITED for $25m?  It can be done, it has been done.  Or maybe this one?  Great idea, great company, market crash, financial markets dry up, everyone laid off and then the eventual bankruptcy- and then EXIT for $50m! It can be done, it has been done. Our formula is simple: 1.	 We assemble seed investment syndication groups (SISG). 2.	The SISG is its own company investing in not one start-up but two at the same time. 3.	The unique fact in this case is IF the best is always 50/50, then let’s leverage the risk across two startups.  But the FLIP strategy does not stop there. 4.	These two startups MUST conform to our very strict participation rules: a.	We as a company and SISG participate in all management decisions, and; b.	We assure the startup has a MINIMUM of 10 Defensive Patents(DP)  protecting the startups innovations, and; c.	The SISG goal is to provide seed, get the 10 DP’s filed and get to Proof of Concept (POC), and; d.	The patents are NOT to file suits but to force market leverage so the company can be form strategic partnerships and then be FLIPPED (now you see where FLIP comes in). 5.	The very worst case is – regardless of the outcome of the startup the Intellectual Property secures the investment.   6.	In conclusion, as an SISG participant you get twice the opportunity for your investment to succeed and twice the security there is some form of exit at the end of the road. FLIP.Ventures has perfected this model.  Our group not only has the startups with amazing IP, but also we have the very unique track record of being able to push through ground breaking patents in 11 months’ time, where most companies hope for 3 to 5 years for a patent to grant.  We prove our expertise at this achievement almost quarter after quarter. If the startups are winners and stand up on their own, then great for the SISG and FLIP.Ventures.  If both startups win, then it’s a double win.  One win and one loses, then there is still an exit to be had of some kind for the losing startup.  Even if both startups fail to mature then the IP always presents an exit strategy. We specialize in ventures where there is from $1.5m to $20m for full POC with the IP and then look to stand them up, prove them out and then FLIP for $200m to $1b or more. We promise you will FLIP when you see what FLIP. Ventures does and how we do it.  Send an email or message to dialog with our team.  If we are a match for you and your investment dollars and you are a match for the type of SISG member we seek as well, then let’s do this FLIP together.",10,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/34220554/admin/,,,Active,Forward Looking Intellectual Property Ventures - A Vencubator.,2013-01-05,day,,,,,,,jhp@flip.ventures,,,"Angel Group, Family Investment Office, Incubator",Seed,2,3,,2,,,,,,"11,635",-0.4,-1.4,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Village offers each accepted company: - An initial seed fund of $25K in return for 8% of company’s equity - Strong Customer Development and Validation focus - Access to an exclusive network of Mentors, Advisors, and Investors - Free office space for duration of the program Our 3-month program focuses on customer development, validation, value proposition canvas, MVP (minimum viable product) definition, consumer and business marketing, branding, go-to market strategy and fundraising. It Takes a Village to Raise a Start-up Mentors, partners, investors, university alliances, and corporate patrons make up our village. This network prides itself on providing our start-ups with the support they need. This is both our network and our village! An exclusive list of top-level mentors from across the nation chooses to donate time, knowledge, and experience to our start-ups. These mentors have demonstrated success and lived a life of their own in the start-up world. They drive our Village to the next level. A key differentiating factor of the CVAP is that start-ups perform extensive customer validation before investing in further product development. After market validation, start-ups work with top-notch market research firms and expert branding mentors. They develop go-to-market and marketing and branding strategies. Start-ups complement their product understanding with meaningful consumer and market insights. Our supporters are vested in CVAP’s success. They are industry leading technology, business services, and legal firms. In addition, top VC firms and local and national angel investors work with CVAP. The Village provides networking opportunities to help you find potential partners and experts who can help propel your start-up to success. Goal Driven We are redefining how accelerators conclude their programs. CVAP is milestone driven, meaning we measure a start-up’s success against its goals. An investor’s view of a company as “I’ll know when I see the product” isn’t a formal way of assessing project maturity or quantifying risk. We provide these investors a common language that communicates objectives to start-ups. We do this by defining Investment Readiness Level (IRL). IRL is a bridge that connects the capital-efficient Lean Startup process and the capital-raising process for founders. Seed Funding? We invest $25k in seed stage funds. With this funding, start-ups perform first hand customer validations. They also develop a strong marketing message while working with market research partners and some of the best agencies in Dallas, TX. Pitch Day? The accelerator world overuses Pitch Days, but we don’t entirely believe in how they are structured. Instead we embrace a philosophy of invite-only investor audience. This allows you to focus on the task at hand without distraction.  Our last cohort’s pitch day had more than 50% of accredited investors present along with key industry advocates, startup connectors and local corporate patrons. Can you make a noise? If you can make some noise, we can help amplify your message. The Village works with media partners to help make the right level of needed noise as part of our go-to market strategy. Benefits? You can’t put a dollar value on the advice and support you will receive throughout the program. But you can expect more benefits including legal advice, hosting credits, discounts from local establishments and other valuable resources. A partner for life! Collide Village will take an 8% equity in your company in exchange for our investment, network, advice, mentorship and access to our priceless Village.",2,http://twitter.com/CollideVillage,http://www.linkedin.com/company/3837183,http://www.facebook.com/collidevillage,,Active,"The Collide Village Accelrator Program (CVAP) is a milestone driven seed stage startup accelerator in the Dallas, TX.",2014-04-01,day,,,,,,http://www.collidevillage.com/,info@collidevillage.com,,,Accelerator,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",1,1,,,,,On-Site,2015-08-04,,"44,458",-0.2,-0.2,-0.4,,148.63,-100%,,,,,,,,,,24,,,8,,,,,,,
