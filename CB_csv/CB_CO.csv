Because of these gaps, numerous companies are frequently underserved and under-recognized by the capital markets. In response, Lacuna has pioneered the Gap Capitalâ„¢ concept. Many entrepreneurs find that their angel funding takes them only so far. At the same time, most established venture funds are gravitating toward larger investments in later-stage companies. As a result, many worthy young companies find themselves caught in the â€œcapital gap.â€ The Lacuna Venture Fund is a new kind of venture fund focused on providing Gap Capitalâ„¢ of $500,000 to $3 million to dynamic early-stage companies that are ready to go to market, but that need the next level of financial and advisory resources to succeed. The Lacuna Hedge Fund invests in select small-cap and micro-cap public companies that fall into the â€œinformation gapâ€ which occurs when small companies are overlooked by Wall Street and the investing public.
