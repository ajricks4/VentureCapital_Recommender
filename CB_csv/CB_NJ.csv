Geocapital Partners,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/geocapital-partners,"Fort Lee, New Jersey, United States",,,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,"Founded in 1984, Geocapital Partners has been a leading venture capital firm focused on investments in young businesses in information services and technology in both North America and Europe. We have successfully managed over $500 million in a series of partnerships that were primarily funded by large institutional investors. After the extraordinary explosion of capital flowing into the venture industry in the late 1990s and beyond, the managing partners of the firm decided, contrary to the industry trends, that bigger was not better. We concluded that great returns and rewarding relationships with promising young companies were not likely to be realized with a sizeable institutional venture fund, and we stopped raising such funds. (To read the letter we wrote to our institutional investors explaining our departure from the world of institutional venture capital funds, click here). In effect, we returned to our roots: finding entrepreneurs who have bootstrapped themselves into the post-startup stage of early revenue generation, for whom experienced equity partners, along with half a million to a few million dollars of equity capital, would be attractive. We now make such investments on a very selective basis, using primarily our own funds. We welcome inquiries from entrepreneurs who believe capital should be used efficiently and who think we might be good partners to help them achieve their vision. While examining the world of opportunities to invest in small growing companies, we also recognized a neglected opportunity to make long-term investments in publicly traded companies with limited trading and small market capitalizations. We characterize these situations as ""publicly traded venture opportunities."" Some of us have organized Kinderhook Partners, LP, a fund that is actively pursuing opportunities to invest in promising growing micro-cap public companies. We either buy blocks of stock from existing shareholders, shares on the open market, or shares directly from a company in order to provide capital.  The success of our portfolio companies has led to a number of IPOs and profitable acquisitions: - Autoweb.com is a nationally branded internet-based marketing service for new and used vehicle purchasing. After its IPO it merged with Autobytel (Nasdaq: ABTZ) 		 - Catalina Marketing (NYSE: POS) provides a wide range of strategic, targeted electronic marketing solutions for consumer goods companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and their respective retailers. 		 - Expert Software (Nasdaq: XPRT) provides budget PC software to the education, hobby, home productivity, and finance segments of the consumer market.

Princeton University,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/princeton-university,"Princeton, New Jersey, United States",,,"East Coast, Northeastern US",,"One of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States, Princeton University is consistently at the forefront of research and academic excellence. This is partially due to its unique approach to education, which stresses the importance of independent study. Princeton’s undergraduate academics grant bachelor’s degrees in the arts and sciences. In their third and fourth years, all undergraduates must pursue independent research in their chosen field of study. Depending on your major and academic goals, this can vary from a lab research to a creative project. The graduate school at Princeton University offers a variety of master’s degrees and Ph.D.’s, as well as continuing education programs to suit diverse academic needs. The graduate school does not use a credit-based system, and your department and advisor will determine your curriculum. Tuition at Princeton is among the most expensive in the country. In light of this, the university aims to support its students with significant financial assistance. Princeton’s need-based financial aid program replaces loans with grants, so that its students won’t be overwhelmed with debt after graduation. These programs and more are available to those who qualify. Tuition costs shouldn’t discourage qualified students to apply to Princeton.

(Goldman Sachs was the last of the firms to maintain it’s partnership structure until 1999). Turning a partnership into a corporation allows for the complete transfer of financial risk to the shareholders. “When things go wrong, it’s their problem and if a firm screws up badly enough, it’s the government’s problem.

The program grew out of a deep interest in improving human health, guided by input from leaders in biomedical research. With the Scholars program, the Foundation began what would become its defining approach to philanthropy: investing in the earliest stages of big ideas that have the power to be transformative. New resources allowed the Foundation to hire its first chief executive officer, Elizabeth Good Christopherson, and open its first office in 2009. In the years that followed, with the addition of new Board members and a strategic outlook, the Foundation continued to build on the Scholars program while expanding its venture philanthropy work to invest in innovative solutions to strengthen our democracy through civic literacy and engagement.
