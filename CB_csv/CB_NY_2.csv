We believe that formulaic approaches to investing lead to risk averse strategies that stifle innovation and differentiation. We actively avoid restrictive boundaries around ideas, growth opportunities and entrepreneur profiles. To find extraordinary opportunities, we are not bound by a particular stage of investment and do not shy away from contrarian ideas. We believe that great companies take root in unconventional places and that successful entrepreneurs frequently break the mold. The ideas we back come from a variety of sources: an MBA student who is trying to change new media advertising practices; an experienced entrepreneur seeking to commercialize a disruptive biofuels technology; or an executive looking to spin out and develop an abandoned asset developed by a pharmaceutical company.  We are seasoned investors who have backed more than 200 companies through multiple cycles. Identifying interesting opportunities and providing capital is just the beginning. We offer deep-sector expertise in today’s high-growth markets, but we do not let any one area of knowledge guide our overall investment strategy.

The firm provides its services to institutions and high net worth individuals. It invests in the public equity and fixed income markets across the globe. The firm employs a global macro-style approach to investing. Moore Capital Management was founded in 1986 and is based in New York, New York. Moore Capital Management, ran by Louis Bacon. Moore, named after Bacon's middle name, is a $10 billion global macro set of hedge funds. The next few funds we will be covering are global macro oriented funds, which is a switch from some of the more value oriented funds we've been covering, like the 'Tiger Cub' funds including Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital , and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global. Global macro funds seek to find investments in whatever market they can gain an edge, whether it be equities, bonds, currencies, debt, commodities, and more. So, keep in mind that these equity positions only represent a portion of the fund's overall holdings. They are not required to disclose holdings outside of equities, notes, and stock options. Louis Bacon is a famed trader and risk manager. He comes from the group of ""offspring"" of the legendary Commodities Corp. Bacon emerged as one of the great macro traders alongside the likes of Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corp), and Bruce Kovner (Caxton Associates). And, interestingly enough, Bacon helped get his firm off the ground when Paul Tudor Jones stopped accepting capital from investors and instead turned them to Bacon's firm. Returning 31% annually since inception in 1990, Bacon can be very proud of his flagship fund, Moore Global Investments, but, it doesn't stop there, as his returns have shown little correlation to the stock market and low volatility. He is the definition of a risk manager. Bacon credits his risk management skills to the futures markets, where he learned to be sensitive to market action. And, he learned such skills at an early age. While getting his MBA at Columbia, he used his student loan money to trade. And, he lost it all. Clearly, he learned a lesson he would never forget. Such a lesson stuck with him as he worked various jobs in the financial industry before eventually starting his own firm. And, in his first year managing Moore Capital Management, he returned 86%. Bacon strives to identify long running macro trends. While he has a longer-term macroeconomic view, he won't let that stop him from making money by trading around the position in the mean time.",47,,,,,Active,"Moore Capital Management, LLC (MCM) is an employee owned hedge fund sponsor.

As an investment fund with a limited time-horizon, GHIF seeks opportunities that have a high probability of successful commercialization within two or three years.  Products with “dual market” potential are of greatest interest; i.e., those that will have a clear impact on public health in developing countries but also have value in high-income countries.  High-volume / low-margin products, such as essential vaccines, are also of significant interest.
